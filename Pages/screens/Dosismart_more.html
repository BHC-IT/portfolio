	<p>Dosismart is built with the help of <a href="https://dosimex.fr" style="color:grey">dosimex</a>. They kindly share with us their physics and nuclear engineering background.</p>
	<p>Dosimex, as an excel based software, already have a huge adoption in the french industry. We build on this to add modern features: historics, import/export, user group and more.</p>
	<p>The application is the first mobile solution to modelize gamma ray exposition.</p>
	<p>We are currently in private beta and we will release a public beta soon.</p>
	<div class="separatorMore"></div>
	<p>The project is built with a microservice architecture. Most services are coded in typescript, with c++ modules binded with node-gyp. The physics calculus service is developed in Haskell.</p>
	<p>All front applications (mobile app, landing page, dashboard) are made with react.</p>
